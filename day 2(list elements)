<ul><li>Wash the basmati rice.</li>
    <p>Before you begin cooking, you need to wash the rice. Fill a large bowl with cold water and pour in the rice. Use your hand to stir the rice in one direction. The water should get cloudy, so pour off the cloudy water. Refill the bowl with water. Continue rinsing the rice until the water is clear.</p>
<li>Soak the rice.</li>
    <p>After you have you rinsed the rice, soak it. Place the rice in a bowl of cold water and let it soak for 30 minutes to 2 hours.[1] Soaking the rice helps the grains expand and be fluffy.</p>
<li>Chop the vegetables.</li>
    <p>If you are adding mixed vegetables, such as carrots, beans, tomatoes, cauliflower, or peas, cut them into smaller pieces. Make sure you wash the vegetables and set them aside, ready to be added to your rice.</p></ul>
